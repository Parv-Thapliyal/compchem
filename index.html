      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a window into the invisible world of atomic interactions. Molecular Dynamics is a computer simulation of physical
        movements of atoms and molecules. The trajectories of
        molecules and atoms are determined by numerically solving the
        classical equations of motion (Newton's equations) for a system
        of interacting particles, where forces between the particles and
        potential energy are defined by molecular mechanics force
        fields.
        This was first accomplished in 1957 and 1959 for a system of
        hard spheres by Adler. Now is applied mostly in materials
        science and modeling of biomolecules

      <h2>Key Points To Remember</h2>
      <section class="section key-section">
        <ul class="holder">
          <li><strong>Each atom is simulated as a single particle</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Each particle has an radius (typically the van der Waals
            radius), polarizability and constant net charge</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Bonded interactions are treated as “springs” with an
            equilibrium distance equal to the experimental or calculated
            bond</strong></li>

      <h2>How MD Simulations Work</h2>
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Basic Principles</h3>
          <p>At the heart of MD simulations is Newton's Second Law of Motion, which describes how objects move when forces act upon them. In the case of MD, these objects are atoms and molecules, and the forces arise from interactions between them.
            Newton's Second Law: F=maF = ma where FF represents force, mm is mass, and aa is acceleration. Simply put, MD simulations calculate how atoms move step by step based on these forces.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Force Fields</h3>
          <p>To describe the time evolution of bond lengths, bond angles and
            torsions, also the non-bonding van der Waals and elecrostatic
            interactions between atoms, one uses a force field.
            The force field is a collection of equations and associated
            constants designed to reproduce molecular geometry and selected
            properties of tested structures. Some well known force fields include:</p>
            <ul class="ls">
              <li><strong>CHARMM:</strong> Used for studying biomolecules like proteins and DNA</li>
              <li><strong>AMBER:</strong> An alternative approach to tracking atomic motion.</li>
            <li><strong>OPLS:</strong>Adds accuracy to calculations.</li>
            </ul>
             
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. Simulation Algorithms</h3>
          <p>To calculate motion efficiently,various algorithm methods are used. They predict particle positions with minimal computational error.
            Some common algorithms include:
          </p>
          <ul class="ls">
            
            <li><strong>Leap-Frog Algorithm:</strong> Widely used in drug discovery and protein simulations</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity-Verlet Algorithm:</strong> useful for modeling organic molecules</li>
            <li><strong>Verlet Algorithm:</strong> Simple and widely used for efficiency.</li>
            </ul></div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>4. Realism Techniques</h3>
          <ul class="ls">
            <li>Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) Instead of simulating an isolated group of molecules, the simulation box "wraps around" so that molecules leaving one side re-enter from the opposite side. This mimics the effect of an infinite system.</li>
<li>Thermostats and Barostats  These control temperature and pressure, ensuring the simulation conditions remain stable.</li>
